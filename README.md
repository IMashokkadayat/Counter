The repository pattern in Android Jetpack is used to:

Separate Concerns: Keeps data access logic separate from business logic.
Centralize Data Management: Acts as a single source of truth, managing data from multiple sources.
Facilitate Testing: Makes unit testing easier by abstracting the data layer.
Ensure Consistency: Provides consistent data handling across the app.
Enhance Scalability: Simplifies adding or changing data sources as the app grows.
